# Notes app - Scrimba project

#### What is used in this project:

- Firebase database
    - onSnapshot - listens to changes in database and updates local data accordingly
    - debouncing - it waits 500 ms before it writes to firebase, if user is not typing, this is good, because there is a limit on firebase
